## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations
- **Administrator Rights Required**: This script needs administrator privileges to access stored WiFi passwords
- **Sensitive Data**: The output file contains plain-text passwords - handle with care
- **Local Use Only**: Designed for personal use on your own devices

### üîí Legal and Ethical Use
- Only use this script on computers you own or have explicit permission to access
- Do not use this tool to access unauthorized networks
- Respect privacy and security policies in your organization

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**"Access Denied" Error:**
- Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions on the system

**"No WiFi profiles found":**
- Check if WiFi is enabled on your system
- Verify that you have previously connected to WiFi networks

**Script fails on non-Windows systems:**
- This script is Windows-specific and uses `netsh` command
- Linux/Mac users should use alternative tools like `nmcli` or Keychain Access

## Technical Details

- Uses Windows `netsh wlan` commands to access WiFi profile information
- Employs regular expressions to parse command output
- Handles encoding issues with special characters
- Provides comprehensive error handling and user feedback
